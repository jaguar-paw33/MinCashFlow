          Welcome !!!
          <br />
          <br />
          Before we begin, let's get a short overview of the functionality of
          this app. <br /><br />
          So, this app basically helps in reducing the load of transactions that
          may occur between multiple persons, either in form debit or credit.
          <br />
          <br />
          Instead, of doing multiple and redundant transactions over and over
          again. This app shows the best possible way consisting of least number
          of transactions for any kind of monetary settlement within persons.

          <br />
          <br />

          The things that one needs to know are ----

          <ol style="line-height: 40px;">
            <li>
              Persons, are represented by P1, P2, P3 ... and so on.
            </li>
            <li>
              Arrow from P<sub>i</sub> to P<sub>i+1</sub> means P<sub>i</sub>
              needs to pay the sum of money shown by the number on the arrow to
              P<sub>i+1</sub>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The left block shows the problem set where money settlement needs
              to be done using multiple transactions.
            </li>
            <li>
              The right block shows the best possible way consiting of minimum
              number of transactions that needs to be done within the given
              persons.
            </li>
          </ol>

          Now, talking about the working of this App. So, This app will help you
          reduce your load even when you dont know how it works.
